# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

  The client, DriverPass, requested an application be developed to aid their customers in studying for their driving tests. It would allow the customer to schedule instructed driving sessions to prep for the DMV driving tests. DriverPass wanted a system that was cloud-based as they weren't interested in maintaining the hardware hosting the app. I believe I captured the system requirements quite well and made writing the system design document easier. One part I would like to revise would be my class diagram. I need more experience in creating class attributes and methods. 
  Reading through the client's interview and putting myself in teh shoes of a user of the system enabled me to understand the client's needs and develop a system around them. Designing a system from the perspective of the user helps me visualize how the system needs to work to give the deisred output. My approach designing software starts with understanding the problem and the desired format of the solution's output. I then think of the methods required to attain that output.
